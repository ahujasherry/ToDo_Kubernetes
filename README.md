## 🌩️ Cloud Computing Project - ToDo Kubernetes
Successfully built a comprehensive cloud computing project of To Do List with Kubernetes and google cloud platform(GCP) . The project involved deploying a web application with a database backend on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Kubernetes. Below are the key achievements and features of this project:

## Project Description 📝
This project is a To-Do List Web Application that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. Users can create, update, edit, and delete to-do items, making it easy to keep track of daily activities and tasks. The primary objective was not the complexity of application but learn and master the cloud and dev ops aspects involved.

## Key Features 🚀
- High-Availability Deployment 🔄 : Implemented a high-availability web application using Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform, ensuring continuous uptime and reliable performance.
- Kubernetes Integration ⚙️ : Utilized Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for efficient cluster management and deployment across multiple nodes using Kubernetes YAML files for configuration.
- Load Balancing ⚖️ : Configured Cloud Load Balancing to distribute traffic evenly across the web application nodes, enhancing scalability and performance.
- Database Management 💾 : Cloud SQL Integration: Integrated Cloud SQL for robust and scalable database services, ensuring seamless interaction between the web application and the database backend.
- Comprehensive Documentation 📚 :Detailed Documentation: Developed detailed documentation including system architecture, deployment processes, high availability configurations, and step-by-step replication instructions.
- External Accessibility 🌐 : Public Access: Configured external IP addresses and DNS management for public access to the application.
- Monitoring and Operational Insights 📈 : Real-time Monitoring: Employed GCP Operations Suite for real-time monitoring and operational insights, enabling proactive management and optimization.
- Innovative Use of GCP Services 🛠️ : GCP Tools: Leveraged various GCP tools such as Container Registry for Docker image storage and Cloud Storage for static file management.

## CI/CD Pipeline 🔄 : Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Pipeline Setup: Built a CI/CD pipeline using Google Cloud Build and GitHub Actions.
- Automated Deployments: Configured automated deployments for both development and production environments.
- Separate Configurations: Implemented separate CI/CD pipelines for development and production, ensuring isolated environments for testing and production.
